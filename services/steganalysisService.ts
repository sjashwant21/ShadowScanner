/**
 * Performs a Chi-Square attack on image data to detect LSB steganography.

 * The attack works by observing pairs of adjacent pixel values (p_i, p_{i+1}).
 * For a natural image, the values of adjacent pixels are correlated.
 * If LSBs are randomized by hidden data, this correlation is disturbed.
 * The Chi-Square test measures if the observed frequencies of p_{i+1} being
 * greater or less than p_i deviate significantly from what's expected in a
 * natural image. A high deviation suggests randomness, and thus, hidden data.
 *
 * @param imageData The pixel data from an HTML canvas.
 * @returns A probability (p-value) from 0.0 to 1.0. A value close to 1.0
 *          suggests that the LSBs are random (suspicious), while a value
 *          close to 0.0 suggests natural pixel correlations (likely clean).
